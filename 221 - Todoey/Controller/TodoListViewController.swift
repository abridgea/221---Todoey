// NTS: To make this view controller the delegate of the search bar, we can create an outlet of the search bar, and set the delegate programatically (e.g., mySearchBar.delegate = self). Or, alternatively, simply right-click from the search bar in the Main.storyboard to the yellow view icon at the top of the view conroller, and select "delegate" from the black window that pops open. Either way works. In this code, the latter was used.

	// At this point, the plist is not created. The line above merely created the path. (This was a comment added before adding Core Data.)

	// After adding Core Data, context property was created. It is a handle to the AppDelegate property persistentContainer's viewContext.

		// NTS: The order of these 2 lines matters greatly. It is important to remove the item from the context before
